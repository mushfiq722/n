          The rupiah (Rp) is the official currency of Indonesia. Issued and controlled by Bank Indonesia, its ISO 4217 currency code is IDR. The name "rupiah" is derived from the Sanskrit word for silver, rupyakam (रूप्यकम्).[2] Sometimes, Indonesians also informally use the word "perak" ("silver" in Indonesian) in referring to rupiah in coins. The rupiah is divided into 100 sen, although high inflation has rendered all coins and banknotes denominated in sen obsolete.
